# Pre-Work Study Guide

## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

This study guide was created for boot camp students so that they can arrange notes easily while learing the basics of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and git.
I built this website for containing notes so when I need to find a solution for a code or project I can look back and see if I have learned it.
The website solves the problem of loosing notes since it is online and can't be lost (Unless Deleted).
From making this project I have learned many basic coding tips and information to help start me coding!

Badges aren't necessary, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## Features

If your project has a lot of features, list them here.

## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute to it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.

## Tests

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.
