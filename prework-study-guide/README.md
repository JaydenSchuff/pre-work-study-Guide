# Pre-Work Study Guide

## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

This study guide was created for boot camp students so that they can arrange notes easily while learing the basics of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and git.
I built this website for containing notes so when I need to find a solution for a code or project I can look back and see if I have learned it.
The website solves the problem of loosing notes since it is online and can't be lost (Unless Deleted).
From making this project I have learned many basic coding tips and information to help start me coding!
